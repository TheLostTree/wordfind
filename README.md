# wordfind
because i hate the new york word puzzles so imma solve that with more personal suffering
uh well
just kinda run it?
its slow 
change the code if u want a version with the more in depth list
change "moresanelist.txt" to "words_alpha.txt" and u should be good
words_alpha takes FOREVER to load so i don't use it
